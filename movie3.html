        of not being preparedHe tried to solve fear by building more armorThat’s why the movie’s theme is:“Tony Stark is
        Iron Man — not the suit.”<a id="infos" href="mark85.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>The Illusion of Power</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The world was introduced to a mysterious terrorist leader who spread fear through threatening broadcasts.
        He appeared powerful, calculating, and unstoppable. Cities trembled at his words.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        But the shocking truth revealed that this so-called mastermind was merely an actor —
        a carefully crafted illusion designed to distract the world from the real threat.
      </p>

  <section>
    <h2>The Real Mastermind</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Behind the curtain stood a brilliant yet bitter scientist. Once ignored and dismissed,
        he transformed rejection into obsession. He developed a powerful biological enhancement
        known as Extremis — a volatile technology capable of regenerating tissue and producing immense heat.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        His mission was not just power. It was revenge. He wanted to prove himself superior,
        not just to one man, but to the world.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why He Failed</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>1. Overconfidence:</strong> He believed technology and enhancement made him invincible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>2. Built on Lies:</strong> His empire was constructed through deception and manipulation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>3. Underestimating the Man:</strong> He thought destroying the suits would destroy the hero.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>4. Obsession Over Growth:</strong> While he clung to resentment, his opponent evolved.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

    <h2>Hero vs Villain</h2>
    <div class="comparison">
      <div>
        <h3>Stark</h3>
        <p>Learns from mistakes.</p>
        <p>Builds to protect.</p>
        <p>Accepts responsibility.</p>
        <p>Proves that the suit does not define the man.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Aldrich Killian</h3>
        <p>Obsessed with past rejection.</p>
        <p>Builds to dominate.</p>
        <p>Manipulates the world.</p>
        <p>Relies on power instead of growth.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Final Message</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The antagonist ultimately fails because power without integrity collapses.
        Technology without humanity becomes unstable. In the end,
        strength comes not from armor or enhancement — but from growth,
        resilience, and accountability.
