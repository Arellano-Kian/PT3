            <h2>TONY STARK</h2> <p>Tony Stark is a brilliant billionaire engineer and the head of Stark Industries, widely recognized for his sharp intellect, innovative spirit, and charismatic personality. A natural problem-solver, he transformed his company from a weapons manufacturer into a force for global innovation and clean technology. Tony is known for his quick wit, confidence, and occasional ego, but he also possesses a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to make the world better. His genius-level engineering talent drives him to constantly create new technology, pushing the limits of what is possible.</p>
            <p>Tony Stark travels to Afghanistan to demonstrate the Jericho missile—only to beambushed and captured by the Ten Rings. Injured by his own weapon, he secretly builds the Mark I armor to escape, returning home determined to shut down Stark Industries’ weapons division. Innovating in his lab, he creates the mini arc reactor, the Mark II, and finally the iconic Mark III suit.</p>
